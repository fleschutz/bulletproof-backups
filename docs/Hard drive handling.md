# How to Handle Hard Drives

Hard drives can easily be damaged by too much physical force, extreme temperatures, or from Electrostatic Discharge (ESD). Special handling is required to protect them from damage.

## The DO's and DON'Ts

- Get tools and cables ready before removing the drive from its ESD bag.
- Stand on a rubber matt when installing drives.
- Keep the drive inside the ESD bag until it is ready to be installed.
- Wear a grounding strap when working near sensitive devices like memory, controller cards, or other electronic boards.
- Power off the computer but leave the power cable pulled in.
- Touch bare metal on computer case. Remove the power plug.
- Hold a hard drive by the sides.
- Be careful when installing data and power connectors to avoid damaging connector pins.
- AVOID subjecting the hard drive to extreme temperatures.
- DO NOT touch the connectors or the Printed Circuit Board.
- DO NOT walk or stand on carpet. They generate static electricity.
- DO NOT drop, jolt, or shake the hard drive. This will damage the drive.
- DO NOT let people touch the drive.
- DO NOT stack drives.
- DO NOT stand drives on it's side.
- DO NOT place anything on top of a drive.
