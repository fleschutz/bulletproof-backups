Data Loss Causes
================

Data loss essentially refers to the destruction of data. It can be intentional, but it’s often not. It can be caused by many things:

* **Human error** -  Either through accidental deletion or formatting, some or all of the data is deleted.
* **Software corruption** - Your file system or data has become corrupted and you’re no longer able to access your data.
* **Infection by viruses or malware** - The virus has attacked your file system and corrupted it, preventing you from accessing your data.
* **Hacker attacks or internal leaks** - Your sensitive data is compromised, putting you and/or your business at risk.
* **Theft of property** - Your data is lost and irrecoverable because it was the only copy you had.
* **Hard drive mechanical failure** - Your hard drive has suddenly stopped working and you’re unable to access your data.
* **Malfunction of other hardware** - A critical hardware component has malfunctioned and you’re unable to access your data.
* **Power failures** - Sudden power failure can interrupt delicate write processes, leaving data in a corrupted state.
* **Natural disasters** - Your data is lost as a result of physical damage caused by a natural disaster.
