Data Backup FAQ's
=================

Why back up at all?
-------------------
* **Backups protect you from data loss -** If your computer crashes or your hard drive fails, you could lose all of your data. Backing up your data protects you from this type of data loss and allows you to restore previous versions of your files.
* **Backups guard you against malware and ransomware -** If your computer becomes infected with malware or ransomware, your data could be encrypted and made inaccessible. Backing up your data protects you from this type of data loss.
* **Recover from data loss more quickly -** If you lose data, it can take a long time to recover. If you have a backup, you can quickly restore your data and get back to work.
Data Gives You Peace of Mind - Knowing that your data is backed up can give you peace of mind. If something happens to your data, you know you have a backup and can rest assured that you can recover it.
* **Remote access -** If you have a backup of your data, you can access it from anywhere in the world. This is extremely useful if you work remotely or travel frequently. All you need is an internet connection, and you can get to your files.

What data should I back up? 
---------------------------
Back up anything that can't be replaced if it's lost. For individuals, it's your entire digital life:

* **Communication** such as: address books, emails, messenger, and so on.
* **Memories** such as: pictures, family photos, travels, videos, etc.
* **Digital favorites** such as: books, music albums, singles, playlists, wallpaper, ringtones, etc.
* **Your work** such as: documents, spreadsheets, financial databases, source code, CAD drawings, etc.
* **Digital wallet** with BitCoins, Ethereums, etc.
* **Digital keys** for the office, internet shops and services, etc.

For businesses, data backup options become a bit more technical — think of backing up customer databases, configuration files, machine images, operating systems, and registry files — and there’s typically an IT department in place to manage them.

What types of data backups are available?
-----------------------------------------
When deciding on a backup data storage strategy, there are different types of data backups you can perform to help protect your personal data. Depending on the size of the data you’d like to protect and the frequency with which you’d like to back it up, you can decide between these three data backup options:         

* **Full backups:** This method backs up every single file on your device. Because of this, the process could take many hours depending on the size of the data. A full backup is recommended when you’re backing up your data for the first time. 

* **Differential backups:** With a differential backup, you’re only backing up files that have changed or have been added since your last full backup. Because of this, differential backups can be performed much more quickly than a full backup. 

* **Incremental backups:** Like a differential backup, incremental backups also only back up data that has been changed or added since the last backup. The difference is that incremental backups will back up any changed data since the last backup, whether it was a full, differential, or incremental backup. These types of backups are often performed by backup software because they can be done frequently due to their small size and fast backup time. 

How to handle hard drives?
--------------------------
Hard drives can easily be damaged by too much physical force, extreme temperatures, or from Electrostatic Discharge (ESD). Special handling is required to protect them from damage:

* Get tools and cables ready before removing the drive from its ESD bag.
* Stand on a rubber matt when installing drives.
* Keep the drive inside the ESD bag until it is ready to be installed.
* Wear a grounding strap when working near sensitive devices like memory, controller cards, or other electronic boards.
* Power off the computer but leave the power cable pulled in.
* Touch bare metal on computer case. Remove the power plug.
* Hold a hard drive by the sides.
* Be careful when installing data and power connectors to avoid damaging connector pins.
* AVOID subjecting the hard drive to extreme temperatures.
* DO NOT touch the connectors or the Printed Circuit Board.
* DO NOT walk or stand on carpet. They generate static electricity.
* DO NOT drop, jolt, or shake the hard drive. This will damage the drive.
* DO NOT let people touch the drive.
* DO NOT stack drives.
* DO NOT stand drives on it's side.
* DO NOT place anything on top of a drive.
* DO NOT force or hammer a drive into a drive bay.
* DO NOT force or hammer drive connections.
* DO NOT block or cover any air filter holes on the drives.

What about starting the backup scripts in parallel?
---------------------------------------------------
No problem, but don't expect much speed gains due to bottlenecks such as same source media or same backup disk.

What about copying other data onto the backup disk?
---------------------------------------------------
No problem, as long as there is enough disk space left.

Why not use a cloud backup only?
--------------------------------
In a real disaster the internet is the first thing that doesn't work and afterward it's the last thing that will be up and running.
In the meantime (which may last days/weeks/months) your backup is out of reach.
